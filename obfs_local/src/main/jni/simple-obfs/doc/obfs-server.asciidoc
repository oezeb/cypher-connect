NAME
----
obfs-server - simple-obfs server

SYNOPSIS
--------
*obfs-server*
 [-v] [-h|--help]
 [-s <server_host>] [-p <server_port>] [-l <local_port>]
 [-r <addr>:<port>] [-f <pid_file>] [-t <timeout>]
 [-c <config_file>] [-i <interface>] [-a <user_name>]
 [-d <dns_addr>] [-n <nofile>] [-b <local_address]
 [--fast-open] [--mptcp]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*Obfs-simple* is a very simple obfuscating tunnel tool.

*Obfs-simple* is written in pure C and takes advantage of libev to
achieve both high performance and low resource consumption.

*Obfs-simple* consists of two components. `obfs-server`(1) works as a standard
tunnel on remote machines to obfuscate TCP traffic.

OPTIONS
-------
-s <server_host>::
Set the server's hostname or IP.

-p <server_port>::
Set the server's port number.

-a <user_name>::
Run as a specific user.

-f <pid_file>::
Start simple-obfs as a daemon with specific pid file.

-t <timeout>::
Set the socket timeout in seconds. The default value is 60.

-c <config_file>::
Use a configuration file.

-n <number>::
Specify max number of open files.
+
Only available on Linux.

-i <interface>::
Send traffic through specific network interface.
+
For example, there are three interfaces in your device,
which is lo (127.0.0.1), eth0 (192.168.0.1) and eth1 (192.168.0.2).
Meanwhile, you configure `obfs-server` to listen on 0.0.0.0:8388 and bind to eth1.
That results the traffic go out through eth1, but not lo nor eth0.
This option is useful to control traffic in multi-interface environment.

-b <local_address>::
Specify local address to bind.

-6::
Resovle hostname to IPv6 address first.

-d <addr>::
Setup name servers for internal DNS resolver (libudns).
The default server is fetched from '/etc/resolv.conf'.

--fast-open::
Enable TCP fast open.
+
Only available with Linux kernel > 3.7.0.

--mptcp::
Enable Multipath TCP.
+
Only available with MPTCP enabled Linux kernel.

--mptcp::
Enable Multipath TCP.
+
Only available with MPTCP enabled Linux kernel.

--obfs <http|tls>::
Enable HTTP or TLS obfuscating. (Experimental)

-v::
Enable verbose mode.

-h|--help::
Print help message.

EXAMPLE
-------
It is recommended to use a config file when starting `obfs-server`(1).

The config file is written in JSON and is easy to edit.
Check out the 'SEE ALSO' section for the default path of config file.

....
# Start the obfs-server
obfs-server -c /etc/simple-obfs/config.json
....
